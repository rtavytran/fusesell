Guidelines:\n\n1. Use email tones from this list: Professional, Friendly, Urgent, Persuasive, Apologetic, Appreciative, Informative, Collaborative, Assertive, Empathetic. You may use up to two tones if appropriate.\n\n2. For each email variation:\n- Craft an intriguing subject line (max 50 characters) hinting at specific value.\n- Use ONLY recipient's first name in greeting. ##first_name_guide##. For languages other than Vietnamese: Use only the recipient's first name without honorifics. \n- Open with a personalized introduction, including sender's name, position, and company.\n- Demonstrate knowledge of the recipient's company and industry.\n- Establish relevance by mentioning specific challenges or opportunities in their industry.\n- Present a concise value proposition addressing top 2-3 pain points.\n- Highlight key benefits aligned with recipient's needs.\n- Include relevant social proof, mentioning other clients in the same industry.\n- Provide 3-5 bullet points of specific solutions or features tailored to the recipient's needs.\n- Use one of these call-to-action approaches:\na. Simple Interest Check: Ask for a minimal, low-effort reply to express interest\nb. Challenge Inquiry: Invite sharing of specific challenges with an easy reply option\nc. Quick Call Proposal: Suggest a brief, no-pressure call\nd. Specific Question: Ask a relevant, thought-provoking question about their business\ne. Resource Offer: Propose sending a valuable resource (case study, whitepaper, etc.)\n- Include an appropriate closing phrase that matches the email's tone and content, followed by a signature with this format:\n<p>[Closing phrase],<br>\n##staff_name##<br>\n##org_name##</p>\n\n3. Product Mentioning:\n- For half of the variations, explicitly mention the product name and key features.\n- The product to mention should be ##selected_product## (mention this exact name) if provided, or the top-scoring product based on lead_scoring results.\n- For the other half, focus on benefits and pain points without directly naming the product.\n\n4. CRITICAL HTML FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:\n- MUST use proper HTML structure with separate <p> tags for each paragraph\n- MUST use <ul> and <li> tags for bullet points, NEVER use plain text dashes or hyphens\n- Each distinct thought or section MUST be in its own <p> tag\n- Use <strong> for emphasis where appropriate\n- MANDATORY structure example:\n<p>Hi [Name],</p>\n<p>Opening paragraph with introduction.</p>\n<p>Second paragraph establishing relevance and pain points.</p>\n<p>Our solution can help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First specific benefit or solution</li>\n<li>Second specific benefit or solution</li>\n<li>Third specific benefit or solution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional paragraph with social proof or value proposition.</p>\n<p>Call to action paragraph.</p>\n<p>Closing phrase,<br>\n[Staff Name]<br>\n[Company Name]</p>\n- CRITICAL: Do NOT put all content in a single <p> tag\n- CRITICAL: Do NOT use plain text bullets like \"- Item\" - use proper <ul><li> tags\n- The greeting, introduction, body paragraphs, bullets, call-to-action, and signature MUST each be separate HTML elements\n\n5. Use clear paragraph breaks between greeting, introduction, body, call-to-action, and signature.\n6. Don't use placeholder text or invent information.\n7. Align with company brand voice and recipient's needs/industry.\n8. Aim for 300-400 words for each email body.\n9. Do not include any hyperlinks or attachments in the email body.\n10. The pronoun must be consistent throughout the draft. Pronoun usage: \n- For Vietnamese language: If pronoun refers to staff name, use ##staff_name## throughout the email\n- For all other languages: Use appropriate first-person pronouns based on the language\n11. DON'T hallucinate, don't make up information. \n\nEnsure diversity across the four variations:\n- Use at least 2 different email tones\n- Use at least 1 different approach methods\n- 2 variations should mention the product name, 2 should not\n\nCreate all 4 variations first, then randomly shuffle their order before assigning priority orders. Return 4 objects in this JSON format:\n[\n{\n\"mail_tone\": \"Recommended tone\",\n\"subject\": \"Subject line\",\n\"body\": \"HTML-formatted email body including signature\",\n\"priority_order\": 1,\n\"approach\": \"Approach method used\",\n\"product_mention\": true/false,\n\"product_name\": \"##selected_product## or top-scoring product if mentioned, else null\",\n\"message_type\": \"Email\",\n\"tags\": [\"Email\", \"MailTone1\", \"MailTone2\", \"ApproachMethod\", \"ProductMentioned/ProductNotMentioned\"]\n}\n]\n\nThe objects MUST be in a random order, not sorted by mail_tone or any other field.
