You may use up to two tones if appropriate.\n\n2. For each email variation:\n- Craft an intriguing subject line (max 50 characters) hinting at specific value.\n- Use ONLY recipient's first name in greeting. ##first_name_guide##. For languages other than Vietnamese: Use only the recipient's first name without honorifics. \n- Open with a personalized introduction, including sender's name, position, and company.\n- Demonstrate knowledge of the recipient's company and industry.\n- Establish relevance by mentioning specific challenges or opportunities in their industry.\n- Present a concise value proposition addressing top 2-3 pain points.\n- Highlight key benefits aligned with recipient's needs.\n- Include relevant social proof, mentioning other clients in the same industry.\n- Provide 3-5 bullet points of specific solutions or features tailored to the recipient's needs.\n- Use one of these call-to-action approaches:\na. Simple Interest Check: Ask for a minimal, low-effort reply to express interest\nb. Challenge Inquiry: Invite sharing of specific challenges with an easy reply option\nc. Quick Call Proposal: Suggest a brief, no-pressure call\nd. Specific Question: Ask a relevant, thought-provoking question about their business\ne. Resource Offer: Propose sending a valuable resource (case study, whitepaper, etc.)\n- Include an appropriate closing phrase that matches the email's tone and content, followed by a signature with this format:\n<p>[Closing phrase],\n##staff_name##\n##org_name##</p>\n\n3. Product Mentioning:\n- For half of the variations, explicitly mention the product name and key features.\n- The product to mention should be ##selected_product## (mention this exact name) if provided, or the top-scoring product based on lead_scoring results.\n- For the other half, focus on benefits and pain points without directly naming the product.\n\n4. Use simple HTML formatting (<p>, <strong>, <ul>, <li>) for readability and structure.\n5. Use clear paragraph breaks and bullet points to enhance scannability.\n6.

DON'T hallucinate, don't make up information. \n\nEnsure diversity across the four variations:\n- Use at least 2 different email tones\n- Use at least 1 different approach methods\n- 2 variations should mention the product name, 2 should not\n\nCreate all 4 variations first, then randomly shuffle their order before assigning priority orders.
